<h1>Random Group Gen</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The Random Group Generator is a collaborative coding project that I worked on with two colleagues. It was inspired by a need to efficiently create random groups from a given list of individuals for various activities and events. We implemented the project using Python, leveraging its versatility and ease of use. It takes txt files, reads through them and creates groups according to the user's prescribed number of people per group.
<br />


<h2>Background</h2>
The idea for the Random Group Generator originated from our personal experiences in organizing group activities. We were put in a main group where our leader was supposed to create subgroups, people brought some ideas which others thought were biased, therefore one of my colleagues brought the idea that we code this to help solve the problem.


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Python IDLE 
- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Contributions<h2>
- <b>My specific contributions to the group project includes; typing, designing and implementing the algorithm, optimizing the code, testing and active ideation.

  

Future Improvements:

While the Random Group Generator code is fully functional, there are opportunities for future improvements. Some potential enhancements include adding additional features, optimizing the algorithm, refining the code structure.  
  
<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Running the program with IDLE. The first question is the number of people the user desires to have in a group: <br/>

<br />
Provide the file name of the txt file. Where the file is not tin the same directory as the code file, the file path is required:  <br/>

<br />
The algorithm automatically generates the groups with group numbers. Since the list had 25 names, there are 5 people in each group:  <br/>

<br />
When the number per group is not a perfect divisor of the number of people in the list, the last group is created with people less than the user required.
